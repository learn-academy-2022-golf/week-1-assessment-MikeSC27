# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is on your computer allowing you to work coding projects offline and off the main branch.  The main branch is on GitHub which is the servers online mostly in Idaho, as I point with my right index finger hoping thats the direction of Idaho.  

Researched answer: Git is the system that keeps track and control of your source code history on your computer and Github is a cloud-based service that manages the Git repositories of source code projects. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Logical Operators: &&, ||, !.  Along with <, <=, >, >=, ===.  Along with other operators slipping my mind right now that bring back a True (?) False (;) response. 
Researched answer: Boolean is great for comparison, Truthy and Falsy values.  This can be done with Logical Operators, Relational Operators, & Equality Operators.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the position in a string or array.  A value is the parameter in the string or array. 

Researched answer: The index is the placement index number of the value in the string or array.  The value is the parameter at each index. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both strings and arrays are indexed and can be declared. However not all built in methods work the same between them such as .lenght. Arrays can also have strings inside of them. 

Researched answer: Both can use similar methods such as .concat, and .indexOf, however not all work the same such as .length. An array is able to hold any of the six data types including strings however a string can only utilize single parameter type data.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair Programming consists of two developers working together online or in person.  One is designated as the driver and the other as the navigator. 
The Navigator does not input any data directly, they instead direct the driver who inputs all data and both can and do visual inspect each line of code.  Ultimatly the Navigator must make sure spelling and syntax is correct.

Researched answer: Two developers sharing the same coding platform work together to create or troubleshoot techical coding.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

2. Jest: A Javascript Testing framework primarily for React used to write tests for code. 

3. Objects: they are what properties and methods are assigned to.

4. Method: these are actions that can be performed on Objects. 

5. Classes: These are the templates for Objects, a type of function that can be declared or named.
